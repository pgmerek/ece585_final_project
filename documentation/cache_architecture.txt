The project description says that this cache will run on a 32-bit processor, so there will be 32 address bits total. 
Both the instruction and the data caches are the same size, so they can both use the same address and tag bits, but we will 
need to use one of the tag bits to indicate whether we are addressing the data or the instruction cache.

The instruction cache will have the following
 -16K sets
 -64 byte lines
 -4 way association
 -Capacity = 4MB
 
 Addressing bits per line
 -14 index bits (1 address for each set)
 -6 byte index bits (1 address for each byte in a line)
 -12 bits for the tag
 
 Tag Array
 -8 bits per set for the LRU
 -8 bits per set for the MESI
 -48 tag bits per set
 -Size for tag array for entire instruction cache is: 128KB (kilobytes)

The data cache will have the following
 -16K sets
 -64 byte lines
 -8 way association
 -Capacity = 8MB
 
 Addressing bits per line
 -14 index bits (1 address for each set)
 -6 byte index bits (1 address for each byte in a line)
 -12 bits for the tag
 
 Tag Array
 -24 bits per set for the LRU
 -16 bits per set for the MESI
 -96 tag bits per set
 -Size for tag array for entire instruction cache is: 272KB (kilobytes)

Addresses will be shared between the instruction and the data caches
