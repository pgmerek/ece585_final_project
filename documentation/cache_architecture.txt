The project description says that this cache will run on a 32-bit processor, so there will be 32 address bits total. 
Both the instruction and the data caches are the same size, so they can both use the same address and tag bits, but we will 
need to use one of the tag bits to indicate whether we are addressing the data or the instruction cache.

I'm not sure if each cache is supposed to have its own 32-bit address or if they should share a 32-bit address, so I am defining the 
addressing separately.

The instruction cache will have the following
 -16K sets
 -64 byte lines
 -4 way association
 
 Addressing bits per line
 -14 index bits (1 bit for each set)
 -6 byte index bits (1 bit for each byte in a line)
 -12 bits for the tag
 
 Tag Array
 -8 bits per set for the LRU
 -8 bits per set for the MESI
 -48 tag bits per set
 -Size for tag array for entire instruction cache is: 128KB (kilobytes)

The data cache will have the following
 -16K sets
 -64 byte lines
 -8 way association
 
 Addressing bits per line
 -14 index bits (1 bit for each set)
 -6 byte index bits (1 bit for each byte in a line)
 -12 bits for the tag
 
 Tag Array
 -24 bits per set for the LRU
 -16 bits per set for the MESI
 -96 tag bits per set
 -Size for tag array for entire instruction cache is: 272KB (kilobytes)
